Global Warming
The earth's surface emits energy into the atmosphere in the form of heat, keeping the balance with the incoming energy. 
Global warming depletes the ozone layer, bringing about the end of the world.
There is a clear indication that increased global warming will result in the extinction of all life on Earth's surface.
Since the industrial and scientific revolutions, Earth’s resources have been gradually depleted. 
Furthermore, the start of the world population’s exponential expansion is particularly hard on the environment.
Simply put, as the population’s need for consumption grows, so does the use of natural resources, as well as the waste generated by that consumption.
